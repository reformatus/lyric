#### Development with GitHub Codespaces

The easiest way to get started is using GitHub Codespaces:

1. Click the **Code** button on GitHub and select **Create codespace on main**
2. Wait for the environment to build (includes Flutter SDK and all dependencies)
3. The devcontainer will automatically run `flutter pub get` and `dart run build_runner build`
4. Run `flutter run` to build and run the app

#### Local development

1. Install the latest [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
1. Clone this repository
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
1. Run `dart run build_runner build` for generated code (drift, riverpod)
1. Run `flutter run` to build and run the app

#### Contributing

As the project and the architecture is still in the early stages, please contact us before starting any contributions.
We'd like to make sure you're going in the right direction before you invest time in a PR.
