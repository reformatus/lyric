**Sófár Lyric** will be your one-stop-shop for making the best setlists, performing from sheet music with your band, and projecting lyrics with sheet music.
It will have an open and growing ecosystem of song libraries.

We are yet far from this future, but please enjoy the beginnings of the app as-is.
Currently our only song library is the one of **Sófár**, which is an association aiding the reformed church of Hungary in all things worship.
